# files-and-folders
The File and Folders project revolves around file navigation and tree data structures. The NLNode class forms the different nodes of the tree, using the iterator class to generate a interactive list of the node's children. In this case, a file will be considered a leaf node, while a directory will become a parent node with its children. The FileStructure class uses recursive methods to generate tree of the nodes, each time a new node is found, the method is recalled with that node being passes as the parameter. By the end, the entire file structure will be complete and navegable by the user.

NLNode and FileStructure were made by me, the rest were files provided by the university
